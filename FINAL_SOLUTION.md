# 🎯 Final Solution: Free Fire Like Bot

## ✅ Problem Completely Resolved

The bot now handles **ALL** possible scenarios correctly:

### 🔧 What Was Fixed

**Original Issue:** Bot was showing "❌ API Error: API returned status code: 500" for various UIDs.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Bot was checking HTTP status instead of API response status
2. Bot wasn't handling HTTP 500 errors properly
3. Bot wasn't distinguishing between "player not found" vs "API errors"

**Solution Implemented:**
- Complete rewrite of the like command logic
- Proper handling of both HTTP 200 with JSON errors AND HTTP 500 errors
- Smart fallback mechanism from India → AG region
- Clear, user-friendly error messages

Please check:
• UID is correct
• Player exists in Free Fire
• UID format is valid

Tried both India (ind) and AG regions.
```
